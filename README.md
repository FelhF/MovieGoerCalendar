### Setup
To run the website, the URL is "https://movie-goer-calendar.vercel.app/"
The setup needed is to run "npm install" to download any required modules. 
if the program is to be run locally, run  npm run dev in /moviecalendar. For backend, run node --watch server.js in /backend. Another change for the program to run properly locally is to change the script in index.html to 
public/script.js.

### URL
https://movie-goer-calendar.vercel.app/

### Reflection
Design: I chose react express, neon postgres for the database and render for the backend. I had not used render before but I had heard it was not to hard to setup, so I chose that. I was familiar with with neon postgres so I chose it for that reason.
Challenge: Because of the way I went about coding the program, I did not make the best use of react express. This resulted in future complicactions.
Learning outcomes: Learning how to deploy a program is something that I had not done before but it likely will be useful in the future.
Future work: I would have added additional features to the calendar itself. For example, Maybe have a date look different if there is an event set for that date. Additionally, the option to filter events based on the date of the calendar chosen. Currently, the event tab is limited to a maximum of four events displays, Maybe add a scroll bar so that more than 4 events can be seeing.
